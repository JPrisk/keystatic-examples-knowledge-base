# Keystatic Example: Knowledge Base

"Puppy Owners Hubg" is a Next.js project demo showcasing how you could use Keystatic to power a knowledge base website.

## Installation

After cloning the repo, install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

You can then start the Next.js dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and the Keystatic Admin UI at `http://localhost:3000/keystatic`.

Happy coding!
